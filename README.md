# Hand Cricket Fun in Python! üèè

Remember playing Hand Cricket with your friends? Now you can bring that simple joy to your computer! This is a super easy-to-run game you can play right in your computer's text window against the computer.

## Get Started!

1.  **Grab the Code:** First, you need to get the game's code onto your computer. Think of it like downloading a file. You might see a button that says "Clone" or "Download" on the page where the code is. Click that!

2.  **Open the Game:** Once you have the code, you'll need to open a special window on your computer called the "terminal" or "command prompt." Don't worry, it sounds scary, but it's just a place where you can type simple commands.

3.  **Tell it to Run:** Inside that window, you'll type a short command to make the game start. It usually looks something like this:

    ```
    python Hand_Cricket_game.py
    ```

Hit the "Enter" key, and the game will begin!

## How to Play (It's Easy!)

* **Your Runs:** On each turn, you and the computer will secretly pick a number from **1 to 10**. That's your "runs"!
* **The Toss:** Like in real cricket, we start with a toss! The game will ask you: "Heads or tails?" Type your choice and see if you win!
    * **Toss Win:** If you guess right, you get to choose if you want to **bat** (score runs first) or **ball** (try to get the computer out first).
* **Playing the Innings:**
    * **Batting:** If you're batting, you type a number (1 to 10). The computer also picks a number.
        * **Score Runs:** If your number is different from the computer's, those are your runs! Keep going until...
        * **You're Out!** If your number is the *same* as the computer's, you're out! Your total score is now the computer's target to beat.
    * **Bowling:** If you're bowling, you type a number (1 to 10). The computer also picks a number (their "batting" runs).
        * **Computer Scores:** If your number is different, the computer gets those runs.
        * **Wicket!** If your number is the *same* as the computer's, you got them out! Their total score is now your target.
* **Winning:**
    * If you batted first, you win if the computer can't score more runs than you.
    * If you bowled first, you win if you get the computer out before they beat your score, and then you score more runs than them!
